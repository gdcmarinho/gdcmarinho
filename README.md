I am a software engineer focused on building secure, efficient, and resilient systems. I value free and open-source software, decentralized technologies, and infrastructure that prioritizes user autonomy. I use whatever programming language or tool best fits the problem—what matters is clarity, maintainability, and performance.

I’m exploring areas like back-end development, compute performance and tools written in Java, Lua and JavaScript/TypeScript. Some of those learnings [you can find on my blog](https://gabrielmarinho.org).
