I am a software engineer focused on building secure, efficient, and resilient systems. I value free and open-source software, decentralized technologies, and infrastructure that prioritizes user autonomy. I use whatever programming language or tool best fits the problem—what matters is clarity, maintainability, and performance.

I’m exploring areas like applied cryptography, compute performance and low level programming languages like C, Assembly and Verilog/VHDL. Some of those learnings [you can find on my blog](https://gabrielmarinho.org).
